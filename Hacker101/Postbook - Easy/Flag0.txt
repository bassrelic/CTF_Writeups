After starting the challenge you will see a Welcome Page to Postbook.

You can either Sign up or Sign in.

Use Sign up and create a account for yourself.
Log in with your Username and Password.

Now you can see a Post timeline in which you can see Posts by the Users:
user
admin

Now we know at least two of the usernames for this site!

Now we can try to access one of the accounts with simple guessing work - bruteforcing the password.

Try simple passwords for the "user" account.

With the password "password" you can login.

You are now rewarded with the flag!
