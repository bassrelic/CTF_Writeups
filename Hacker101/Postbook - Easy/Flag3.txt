To be honest, i have no idea how you would find this flag without the hint for it.
I could not find anything more after completing the other six flags.

If we Check the hint, it says:
189 * 5

So the hint is 945.
I figured this could be an ID - even tough it is way higher than any other id we have seen so far.

After some trial and error, i found the flag while viewing the post with id 945.
/index.php?page=view.php&id=945

I created a python script using https://github.com/kazuar/login_scraper_example/blob/master/login_scraper_example.py as template.
The script logs in using the user account and checks for the FLAG in every post id in a specified range.

There is probably a easier way to find this Flag though - Still looking for it.
