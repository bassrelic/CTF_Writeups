How do we stay signed in after providing our login information?
There is probably a cookie!
Can we alter this cookie to become admin?

Sign in with any account (i am using user)
Let us check for cookies.
Right click on the page and select "Inspect Element" anywhere.(firefox)

Navigate to "Storage Inspector" and open the "Cookies" dropdown on the left.
There is a Cookie named id!
The data inside is not readable, maybe it is a hash?
Copy the ID.
c81e728d9d4c2f636f067f89cc14862c

Now paste it into a decryptor tool.
I am using md5hashing.net for this purpose.

Paste the Data into the "Hash String" field to the right.
Select "Search by all hash types" in the "Hash type" field.
Click Decode!

A Md5 hash was found!
The data we obtained are decrypted to "2".
The hash used was:
c81e728d9d4c2f636f067f89cc14862c

Copy this hash and paste it into the field "Hash String"
As "Hash type" we can now select Md5.
As we know, the admin has a lower id than us.
Put a 1 into the text field to the left and hash it.

The resulting Data is:
c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b

Paste it into your cookie in the "Storage Inspector".
Now click on "My profile"

We are admin now!

Navigate to Home and aquire your Flag.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ BONUS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Noone likes to always past the hashed data into a cookie to become admin.
Let us acquire / change the admins password shall we?

Navigate to Settings.
Now you could change the password right away.

But what is his password? Could we have guessed it easily?

Right clik into the password field and select "Inspect Element".(firefox)

There is his password in plain text!

With a brute force method we would probably need a few more days.
