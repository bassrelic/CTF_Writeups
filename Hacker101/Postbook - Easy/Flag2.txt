Let us have another look at the creation of posts.

Rightclick on the form where you can write your next post and use "Inspect Element"(Firefox) again.

There is hidden data here!
<input type="hidden" name="user_id" value="2">		(Logged in as "user")

It seems that not only the Posts have an id, the users do also have one...
Wondering who the user with the id 1 is?

Change the value to 1.
<input type="hidden" name="user_id" value="1">

Write some text in the form and post it!

Your text is now posted with the Author: admin!

Also you are rewarded with the Flag!
