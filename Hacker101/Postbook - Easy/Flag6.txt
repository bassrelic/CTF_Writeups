Lets have another look at the "My profile" tab.
There is the option to delete our posts.

Maybe the admin would be surprised to see that his posts start to disappear?

Right click on "delete" and select "Inspect Element"(Firefox).
There is another id!

This time it seems to be more complicated.
index.php?page=delete.php&id=eccbc87e4b5ce2fe28308fd9f2a7baf3

Maybe it was generated using a hash?
Copy the id and paste it into a decrypt tool.
I am using md5hashing.net for this purpose.

Paste the id into the field "Hash" on the right (Decrypt).
We do not know which hash could have ben used so select under "Hash type" "Search by all hash types".
Click Decode!

A hash was found (Md5):
eccbc87e4b5ce2fe28308fd9f2a7baf3

In my Case the decoded value is 3.
That is the id of the Post itself!

Let us target the diary of our admin.
The id of his post is 2, so let us hash this id with the found hash!

Copy the hash and post it in the field "Hash String".
Select Md5 as "Hash Type".
Write the desired id (2) into the text field on the left.
Click "Hash it!" !

The resulting id is:
c81e728d9d4c2f636f067f89cc14862c

Let us paste this into the id parameter:
index.php?page=delete.php&id=c81e728d9d4c2f636f067f89cc14862c

Now Click delete.

The admins post is gone and you are rewarded with the Flag!
