Lets create a new Post with our newly acquired account.

On the top of the timeline you can see a field which says "What's on your mind?".
Type something for testing purposes.

NOTE: there is a checkbox saying "For my own eyes only".
Maybe there is a way to acquire private posts from other users?

First, lets create a normal post as reference.
Now, lets create a private post.
Click the checkbox saying "For my own eyes only" and post your text.

Now lets inspect the Site:
Rightklick on the normal Post and select "Inspect Element"(Firefox)
You can see that this element has the id 4: index.php?page=view.php&id=4

Now check the Secret post to see where they differ.
Notice that the post was created just like a normal post with a incrementing id!
Thus the secret post has the id 5: index.php?page=view.php&id=5

A quick look on the timeline reveals that there are only four posts visible to you.
Maybe there is another secret post?

Paste the $_GET string into your search bar.

Now lets try to find the missing post by altering the id.

It seems that the admin tried the secret feature of his website. The posts ID is 2!

You are rewarded with the secret thoughts of the admin and with the Flag you are looking for!
